# SE-Assignment-2
Assignment: Introduction to Software Engineering
Instructions:
Answer the following questions based on your understanding of software engineering concepts. Provide detailed explanations and examples where appropriate.

Questions:
Define Software Engineering:

What is software engineering, and how does it differ from traditional programming?
1. Software engineering is a process of creating (developing) programs that assist with specific tasks. Traditional programming is only about the code , while software engineering has the SDLC which includes processes such as planning, designing, defining, building, testing and deployment which alows the maintenance of the program. 

Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC):

Explain the various phases of the Software Development Life Cycle. Provide a brief description of each phase.

2. the Software Development Life Cycle include:
Planning- which gives a vision on how the program that is being devoloped will function and highlight the key objectives that want to be achieved. 
Defining- highlighting how the program should be used.
Designing- this process is when color and user interfaces come to play to determine how it should look.
Building- is when programmers write code.
Testing- this processes ensures that there are no bugs that will cause the code to clash.
Deployment- after testing is when the program is released so people can use it.

Agile vs. Waterfall Models:
Compare and contrast the Agile and Waterfall models of software development. What are the key differences, and in what scenarios might each be preferred?
3. Agile and Waterfall models of software development are similar the only difference is that the waterfall model has a maintainance process and Agile instead has a review process. Waterfall models are used in programs that are large scale and does not allow any errors in the programs and need updates. Agile model are used in programs that are on going and the objective or goal is changing as agile model is good with adaptation.

Requirements Engineering:

What is requirements engineering? Describe the process and its importance in the software development lifecycle.
4. Requirement engineering is is the part of engineering that looks at the processes of developing a program and the program requirements.  The process is relatively straight forward as it documents an establishes the requirement of the programs this includes steps like analysis, validation etc. which is important to note in the SDLC as it dertimines the planning and defining of the software.
Software Design Principles:

Explain the concept of modularity in software design. How does it improve maintainability and scalability of software systems?
5. Modularity in software design is dividing software into modules, so each module can handle a specific task in the software. This improves maintainability as if a specific part of the software is not operating as design they can easly target the module that is incharge of that task and scalability if we want to add new concept that can improve our program we can create a new module to handle that part in the software.
Testing in Software Engineering:

Describe the different levels of software testing (unit testing, integration testing, system testing, acceptance testing). Why is testing crucial in software development?
6. Unit testing is testing assigning specific tasks to the component individualy to see if they are working.
Intergration testing is testing all the units combine to see if they are able to work together.
System testing is testing all the units in the software to see if the software meet all the requirement.
Acceptance testing is is the final level of testing where we sre testing to see if it ready to be released.
The testing stage is crucial so that the software we create work aa planned and designed before deployment.
Version Control Systems:

What are version control systems, and why are they important in software development? Give examples of popular version control systems and their features.
7. Version control system is a process of tracking and managing changes in the software and it is important as it tracks the changes in the life of the software for analysis process and to see how far the software has come examples of version control systems are Git, Azure DevOps Server etc.
Software Project Management:

Discuss the role of a software project manager. What are some key responsibilities and challenges faced in managing software projects?
8. Software project manager is there to ensure that time, budget, resources are not wasted when making this software. The key challenges are communication (teamwork), deadlines should be met, documentation of everything happening in the project , keeping up with the changes in technology.
Software Maintenance:

Define software maintenance and explain the different types of maintenance activities. Why is maintenance an essential part of the software lifecycle?
9. Software maintence is the process of keeping the program running smoothly and it has the processs of changing anything that is wrong with the project , modifying and updating the software which intails adding new features into the software or improving a featur in the software.
Ethical Considerations in Software Engineering:

What are some ethical issues that software engineers might face? How can software engineers ensure they adhere to ethical standards in their work?
10. Unethical data collection, weak security of personal information just to name a few are the problems that software engineers face and the easiest way to combact this is education, creating a eductional print to tell the users what the dangers are or try to limits the risks as much as possible .

Submission Guidelines:
Your answers should be well-structured, concise, and to the point.
Provide real-world examples or case studies wherever possible.
Cite any references or sources you use in your answers.
